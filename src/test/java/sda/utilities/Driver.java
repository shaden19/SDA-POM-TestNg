/*
    In the POM, instead of extending the TestBase class for Driver,
    it is preferred to create and configure the driver using static methods from the Driver class,
    and closing the driver at the end.
    To prevent the instantiation of Driver class's getDriver() as an object in the POM,
    Singleton pattern usage is adopted.
    Singleton Pattern: Used to prevent the instantiation of a class from different classes.
    To achieve this, the constructor used to create an object is made private.
    When the constructor is private, it is not possible to create an object from outside classes using the 'new' keyword.
